//  element is not cheap — the browser stands up a fresh decoder and media
//  pipeline for each one — and this game asks for a `shoot` every 0.13s on
//  the Torch, plus a `hit` per impact and an `explode` per kill. Dozens of
//  media elements a second is enough to drop a phone to a crawl, which is
//  exactly what turning the sound on did.
//
//  Each clip is decoded once into an AudioBuffer instead. Playing one is
//  then a BufferSource, which is what the Web Audio API expects you to
//  create and throw away per note, and costs approximately nothing.

//the context is suspended does nothing at all — and the old code marked the
